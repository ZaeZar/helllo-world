# helllo-world
Learning git with the good ol' hello-world.
-This Branchin system looks really cool, I bet it'll be awesome for collabs
=We can not only experiment new features, but also turn the whole purpose of our
 product sideways, without in any way affecting our main product.
-Also eith each branch comes a different readme, that can include detils about our new ventures
-can't wait to use git.....XD
